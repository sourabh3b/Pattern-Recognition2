# Pattern-Recognition2
To make exact inferences about probabilistic graphical models


Problem 1: Draw the moral graph, triangulated graph and the junction tree. 
Explain why the "running intersection property" is satisfied in your junction tree.

Problem 2: Describe how the different terms on the right hand side of "p(V ) = p(a)p(t | a)p(s)p(l | s)p(b | s)p(e | t, l)p(d | e, b)p(x | e)" are distributed among the different juction tree clusters. 
Write out the messages using these terms and verify that the message passing algorithm indeed gives the cluster marginals.
